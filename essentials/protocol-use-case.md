# Protocol use-case üëç

The Auxilium protocol has several use-cases which we are looking forward to expanding. As you've already learned on the "[What is Auxilium?](../)" page, we are aiming forward to make it a great investment for everyone, compensate rug pull victims, and generate enough yield to become the most sustainable protocols in DeFi 3.0\
\
**We are in it for the tech!**\
****\
****So what use cases are there? \
\
The Auxilium team has been working very hard in order to simplify the claiming feature which will be a huge part of our protocol. The smart contract will hold information and a snapshot of the malicious contract and provide an airdrop to those who qualify for the claim. The pool of contracts within the smart contract itself will be voted on by the community. This way we will avoid any so-called "sniping".\
\
Investors who are looking for long terms gains are entitled to stake the token after launch for decent rewards. The rewards distributed to the staking addresses are paid out in $HELPR which can also be earned in our pools. \
\
The biggest feature of our protocol is the "Genesis NFT" which grants access to a boosted APR. But please don't worry that our early investors and "breeder" are going to release a lot of tokens on the open market causing inflationary prices. Every wallet address is limited to selling a certain amount of tokens within the time frame of 12 hours. \
\
Breeding is a way of getting the airdropped NFTs out of circulation by burning them. As the rug pull victims receive the airdropped NFT, it is also recognized by our frontend as stake-able tokens. We want to minimize the amount of tokens we are handing out, and that exactly is the reason why we have implemented a system that will be deflationary as well as rewarding for everyone. You can read more on our "Tokenomics" page.\
