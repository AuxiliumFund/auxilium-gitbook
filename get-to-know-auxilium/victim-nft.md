# Victim NFTðŸ˜¥

Victim NFTs are available to everyone who invested in a honeypot, scams or rug pulls in general. The team will provide snapshots for every rug pull that has been voted on. The NFT will not be available for those who sold before or bought after the rug pull happened. The snapshot will only include the wallets that were affected after the scam has been pulled. \
\
The victim NFT grants the user free $VICTIM tokens and can then be staked for less APR (than the usual staking). One feature that will give the victim NFT holder quick profits, is that the NFT can also be sold to someone that is looking forward to collecting the victims in order to breed it to a Genesis. The floor price will rise a lot as the majority will look for the boosted APR on our protocol.\
\
So there are 2 possibilities for victim NFT holders:\
\
They can stake it for less APR or sell it immediately after claiming it to someone who is aiming to breed those NFTs. \
\
The NFT can only be claimed once per wallet. If you have been involved in several rug-pulls, you will be automatically disqualified from claiming the NFT another time.
