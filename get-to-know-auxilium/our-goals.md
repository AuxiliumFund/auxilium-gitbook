# Our Goals üèÜ

‚ñ≤ Sustainability \
‚ñ≤ Scalability \
‚ñ≤ Efficiency \
\
Our team wants everyone to win, and that's the reason why the founder of our protocol, "0xzan", has come up with this idea after being a part of so many projects in DeFi which unfortunately weren't able to sustain 1-3 months at max. We want to fix that. We also want to be recognized as a team that is here for everyone, and most importantly, here to stay!\
\
This project has been inspired by many other plays in DeFi such as Olympus DAO, OpenDAO, Wonderland, Ring, THOR, STRONG, and Universe. \
\
The community will pave the way for the future of Auxilium and we will continue the development of future additions to our protocol.
