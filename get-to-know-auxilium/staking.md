# Stakingâœ¨

Staking is available to everyone. For some decent gains, you will be able to stake your $AUXL and receive $HELPR token in return. The APR is variable and can change every day or even every other hour. This will be a great tool in order to make some profits long-term. You won't be able to make quick turnarounds via staking, though.\
\
The liquidity for the $HELPR token will be provided by those who participate in the Liquidity Pool bonding. The available bonds are AVAX-HELPR LP and AVAX-AUXL LP. The $HELPR token is not backed or pegged by anything.
