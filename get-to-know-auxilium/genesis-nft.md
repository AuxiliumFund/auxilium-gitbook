# Genesis NFT üñºÔ∏è

The Genesis NFTs are a core part of Auxilium. They are available to early investors in the protocol (whitelist + first XY investors). The Genesis NFTs entitles the holders to receive a boosted APR (TBD) and receive our $HELPR token. The Auxilium frontend recognizes whether the holder has the Genesis NFT in his/her wallet and thus allows for the boosted APR.

But what if you did not get your hands on a Genesis NFT through the whitelist or you were not among the first XY investors?

Do not worry. We got you! You will also be able to breed a Genesis NFT through acquiring Victim NFTs on the open market.

The breeding process will be explained in the next few sections.
