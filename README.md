# What is Auxilium? ðŸ¤”

Auxilium (**$AUXL**) is a DaaS service on the Avalanche network that primarily compensates rug pull victims and lets them re-invest or sell their airdropped NFT for quick profits. The team is focusing on sustainability and use cases on-chain. The 3 main elements of this protocol are **NFTs**, **Staking/Liquidity** as well as **Compensating.** \
\
When it comes to generating yield through NFT staking, the protocol has 3 different tiers you have to differentiate:\
\
â–² Genesis Tier (**NFT**)- which generates the highest ROI and is only available to either "Breeder" or "Early Investors" who were lucky enough to be one of the first 500 holder contract addresses.\
\
â–² Investor Tier (**Investment**)- which can be used by anyone for a decent return of investment. \
\
â–² **** Victim Tier (**Compensation**) - Rug pull victims will receive the compensation via airdrop and is stake-able for "less APR" than the one available on the Investor Tier. The good thing about this is that no initial investment is required. \
